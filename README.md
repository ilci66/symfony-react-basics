Learning to use react and symfony together. The code used in this tutorail is a bit dated and I had to fix couple of issues but I think I understand enough to start practising on my own. I can always read the documents. 

## What I have learnt
*   React and symfony can go together to create a powerful web app
*   Now I know more about symfony than yesterday

### Plans for next project
*   I will include **mysql**
*   I will definitely **dockerize** and include **nginx**
